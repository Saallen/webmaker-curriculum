#Module 1. Collecting Assets (3 units)

In this module, learners begin to learn about what makes the web a unique place to find and gather information. Together, we'll begin collecting content we would like to build a webby project around. This will help learners determine their story and purpose for a web project.

##Learning objectives and Assessment

By the end of this module, the learner should be able to access the web using the common features of web browsers and use hyperlinks to access a range of resources on the web. They will learn to manage information from various sources on the web, locate or find desired information within search results, and they should be able to research the authorship and ownership of websites and their content.

The following competencies of the [Web Literacy Map](https://webmaker.org/resources) are relevant to this module - along with the relevant 'maker' badges.
